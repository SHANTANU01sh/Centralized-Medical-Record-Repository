# Centralized-Medical-Record-Repository
# 🩺 Centralized Medical Record Repository

A lightweight and modular web application for organizing, summarizing, and visualizing personal medical records — built with Python and Streamlit.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Managing medical records can be messy and overwhelming. This application streamlines the process by allowing users to upload their medical PDFs, which are then:

- Categorized (e.g., prescriptions, test reports)
- Parsed for important details
- Summarized in plain language
- Visualized through interactive health trends

The goal is to make medical information more accessible and meaningful to both patients and healthcare professionals.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 Secure user authentication (with hashed passwords)
- 📁 Upload and auto-categorize PDF medical records
- 🧠 Extract important data: symptoms, medicines, test outcomes
- 📝 Generate clean, readable summaries
- 📊 Interactive health data visualization using Plotly
- ⚙ Fully modular codebase

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- *Frontend & Backend*: Python, Streamlit  
- *Database*: SQLite  
- *PDF Handling*: PyMuPDF  
- *Data Visualization*: Plotly  
- *Other Tools*: dotenv, hashlib, re, os, pandas, datetime

## ⚠ Known Challenges

- Inconsistent formatting across different medical PDFs made parsing and data extraction challenging.
- Fine-tuning regex logic for reliability took significant effort.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add cloud storage integration for multi-device access
- Support for image-based PDFs using OCR
- Multi-user dashboard for doctors and caregivers
